## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deferred blockcommit queue in IStateManager

`IStateManager` SHALL provide methods for managing a deferred blockcommit queue: `get_deferred_operations(vm_name) -> list[DeferredBlockcommit]`, `add_deferred_blockcommit(vm_name, snapshots, reason)`, `clear_deferred_operations(vm_name)`. `DeferredBlockcommit` SHALL be a frozen dataclass with fields `snapshots: list[str]`, `reason: str` (`"apparmor"` | `"selinux"`), `since: datetime`, `last_warned_at: datetime | None` (default `None`).

#### Scenario: Add and retrieve deferred blockcommit

- **WHEN** `add_deferred_blockcommit("vm1", ["snap1.qcow2"], "apparmor")` is called
- **THEN** `get_deferred_operations("vm1")` returns a list containing one `DeferredBlockcommit` with snapshots=["snap1.qcow2"], reason="apparmor", last_warned_at=None

#### Scenario: Clear deferred operations

- **WHEN** `clear_deferred_operations("vm1")` is called after adding two deferred items
- **THEN** `get_deferred_operations("vm1")` returns an empty list

#### Scenario: No deferred operations for VM

- **WHEN** `get_deferred_operations("vm_new")` is called for a VM with no deferred state
- **THEN** the method returns an empty list

#### Scenario: last_warned_at persists across state round-trip

- **WHEN** a deferred blockcommit with `last_warned_at=datetime(2025, 7, 13)` is written to state and read back
- **THEN** `last_warned_at` has the same value

#### Scenario: Old state file without last_warned_at is backward-compatible

- **WHEN** a state JSON file lacks `last_warned_at` in a deferred entry
- **THEN** `_dict_to_deferred()` constructs a `DeferredBlockcommit` with `last_warned_at=None`
